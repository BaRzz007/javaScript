## Values
values are data.
Values comes in two forms in JS: **primitive** and **object**.

```js
console.log("My name is Ezekiel")
```

The value `"My name is Ezekiel"` is a primitive string literal.

##Functions

## How we organize in JS
### classes
A class is a definition of a type of custom data structure that include both data and behaviors hat operate on that data. A class defines how such a data structure works but is not concrete value in itself.
To get a concrete value, a class must be *instantiated* (with the `new` keyword) one or more times.
