From *zero* to *hero* in **JavaScript**
----------------------------------------

- [Hello world!](helloWorld.js) - My first js code *16/01/23*

## Values
values are data.
Values comes in two forms in JS: **primitive** and **object**.

```js
console.log("My name is Ezekiel")
```

The value `"My name is Ezekiel"` is a primitive string literal.

## Functions

## How we organize in JS

### Classes
A class is a definition of a type of custom data structure that include both data and behaviors hat operate on that data. A class defines how such a data structure works but is not concrete value in itself.
To get a concrete value, a class must be *instantiated* (with the `new` keyword) one or more times.

- [Class definition and instantiation](02_class.js) - *16/01/2023*
#### class inheritance
- polymorphism -

### Modules
MOdules pattern in JS has essentially same goal as the class pattern, which groups data and behavior together into logical units. Also like classes, modules can "include" or "access" the data and behaviors of other modules, for cooperation's sake.

#### classic modules

#### es modules
